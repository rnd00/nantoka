# なんとか

Made because:
- I need some place where I can note down stuffs, accessible from everywhere, not めんどくさい like making a blog or something
- Getting used to git commands and whatnots
- Writing them down in *markdown*
- Things written here might be dumb later, but it would serve as something I could laugh out later on too

## [6/26]

### thoughts:
- check internal load balancer
- how to connect different microservices inside different clusters where everything is connected with api calls?
- error logging with EFK but different cluster?
- so there has to be like webhook?
- *how to make a multi-cluster connections without going through authentication and other めんどくさい stuffs?*
- most of it was about loadbalancing in each region (less lag?)
### might help:
